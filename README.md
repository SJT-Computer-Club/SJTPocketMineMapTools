SJTPocketMineMapTools
=====================

A PocketMine-MP plugin that provides a set of tools for working collaboratively on a map.

To run this plugin during development (i.e. non-Phar), first install the Official DevTools plugin. Instructions for setting up a development plugin environment are here: https://github.com/PocketMine/Documentation/wiki/Plugin-Tutorial

For development, clone the plugin code to `[PocketMine Folder]/plugins/SJTMapToolsSource`
For production, install the phar file at `[PocketMine Folder]/plugins/SJTMapTools.phar`

On first run, the plugin will create a folder `[PocketMine Folder]/plugins/SJTMapTools` and will also clone the regions repository into `[PocketMine Folder]/plugins/SJTMapTools/data/regions`
